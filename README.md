# 3D-Rubiks-Cube
Here we used C++ and OPENGL to create a 3D rubiks cube in Dev-C++. WE can view the rubiks cube from different angle and rotate the different side to solve it using keyboard.

Mouse events:

     "+" = zoom in
     "-" = zoom out

Selection of side of rubiks

      x-axis
           "i" = select face 1 
           "o" = select face 2
           "p" = select face 3

        y-axis
           "j" = select face 1 
           "k" = select face 2
           "l" = select face 3

        z-axis
           "b" = select face 1 
           "n" = select face 2
           "m" = select face 3
 
 Viewing the cube from different angle

     "up arrow"    = move the rubix cube upward
     "down arrow"  = move the rubix cube downward
     "left arrow"  = move the rubix cube left
     "right arrow" = move the rubix cube right
     
Rotation of sides

     "q" = rotate counter clockwise
     "e" = rotate clockwise
